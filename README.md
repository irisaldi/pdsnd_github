### Divvy Bikeshare Stat

Crunch some stats out of [**<ins>Divvy Bikeshare</ins>**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divvy) data.

### Description

**Divvy Bikeshare Stat** is a statistic project based on the *Divvy bicycle sharing system* data in Chicago, New York City, and Washington. At the moment, our available data spans from January to June 2017.

The statistic part is made available by utilizing [**<ins>Python</ins>**](https://www.python.org) programming language and its powerful data manipulation tool [**<ins>pandas</ins>**](https://pandas.pydata.org).

#### Getting Started

1. **Download/Clone Repository**
To run the code, you are free to download this repository into your local machine.

If you're familiar with [**<ins>Git</ins>](https://git-scm.com/download), please clone our repository:

>   ```bash
>   $ git clone https://github.com/irisaldi/pdsnd_github.git
>   ```

2. **Install Python and Create Python Environment**
You're going to need Python 3 and we highly recommend to install it from the most recent package and environment management [**<ins>Miniconda3</ins>](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest) release. After a successfully installation of Miniconda3, create a conda environment by using `environment.yml` file we provided.

Open your command prompt and run this command:

>   ```bash
>   $ conda env create -f environment.yml
>   ```

3. **Execute `bikeshare.py`**
Before you execute the `bikeshare.py` code, you need to activate the environment you created in step 2. If you haven't signed a new name for your environment, then this following command should do:

>   ```bash
>   $ conda activate nano_env
>   ```

Now, please run this code from whatever your current directory is:

>   ```bash
>   $ python <your-path-to-pdsnd_github-directory>/bikeshare.py
>   ```

Once it executed, follow the instruction prompted on your screen.
